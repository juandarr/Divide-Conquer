# Divide & conquer

In this repository I will be re-exploring the divide and conquer paradigm. One of the key concepts of this paradigm is recursion. An initial exploration is achieved exploring the simple multiplication problem that we all learned to solve at school. We move from this simple, direct multiplication algorithm that showcases O(`n^2`) **time complexity** to a recursive, more powerful one with `O(n*log(n))` **time complexity**. An improvement to this algorithm is achieved using Karatsuba multiplication. Under this new method we need 3 recursive calls instead of 4. 

# Instructions

The programs presented in this repository don't have dependencies in additional to python standard library. Just run '''python file_name.py''' and you will see the results in the terminal.
