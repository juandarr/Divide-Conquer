# Divide & conquer

In this repository I will be re-exploring the divide and conquer paradigm. One of the key concept of this paradigm is that of recursion. An initial exploration is achieved exploring the simple multiplication problem. We move from the default multiplication algorithm learned at school to a recursive, more powerful one with O(n*log(n)) time complexity. An 
additional improvement is perform using Karatsuba multiplication, which requires only 3 recursive calls instead of 4. 

# Instruction

The programs presented in this repository don't have dependencies in additional to python standard library. Just run '''python file_name.py''' and you will see the results in the terminal.
